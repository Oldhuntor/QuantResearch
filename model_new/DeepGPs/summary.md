1. the further the layer, the more flatten out the data is 
2. Skipping layer, your function not only get the input from the last layer but also the input x

# why people do deeplearning not deep GPs
Because of Tensorflow differentiation

# what's a good quantification of uncertainty?

add GPs layer to CNN networks, better UQ? No!
